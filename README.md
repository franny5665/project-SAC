Mental health is very important to a persons overall health and well-being. Mental health is composed of emotional, physiological, and social aspects of our lives. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has brought a lot of changes to our lives whether it be work, childcare, ability to leave the house, etcetera. As a result of these changes, our emotional, psychological health, as well as our social lives have been impacted, and not necessarily for the better. What we are asking is how has the COVID-19 pandemic affected children's overall mental health and well-being? We will be using the kids count data book that looks at the in child well-being. 
We will be analysising the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic such as social distancing on adolescents between the ages of 5-12. We will evaluate the effects of the pandemic on childrens overall mental health and well-being. Based on the data, we can say there is an impact on the mental health of young childrens. The social distancing and stay-at-home orders had impacted childrenâ€™s mental health especially ages between 5-12.
